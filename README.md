# Docker Image for Managing IaC and other Ops Tasks
This image is used as "golden" image for combating your IaC and/or other Ops tasks. The main purpose for this image is to be used as a Jenkins build agent but can be used locally if desired. Currently the image contains the following tools:

- python 2 and 3
- pip
- git
- make
- ansible
- terraform
- packer
- aws cli
- docker
- docker-compose 

Feel free to adjust but beware that the more tools you add the larger the image gets.
